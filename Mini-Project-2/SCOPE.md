## Project Scope

As mentioned in the project's README.md, this is a stretch project 
and new so, it is highly likely that the scope will continuely adapt 
to changing discoveries, requirements, and complexity.

In fact, one of my inital concerns is the simulation itself is too
simple. and does not carry enough weight. Time will tell.


### Data Set

The data set is too large to fit into (uploaded) to Canvas so, a 
representative set for 2022 is provided. However, teams are expected
to download 2023, and 2024 data.
